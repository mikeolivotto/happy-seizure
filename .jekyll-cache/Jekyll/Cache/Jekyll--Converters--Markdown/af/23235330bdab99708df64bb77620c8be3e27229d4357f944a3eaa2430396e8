I"B<p>Yellowstone National Park, tucked away in Northwest Wyoming, is one of those bucket-list places that is easy to dream of seeing, but for distance, time and expense factors, never feels like it is truly on the cards. My interest in the park was heightened after reading Bill Bryson’s <em>A Short History of Nearly Everything</em> which, among other things, detailed how the park sits atop a ‘super volcano’ which has shaped the park’s unique beauty, the effects of previous devastating eruptions, and the terrifying fact that it could blow again at any time.</p>
