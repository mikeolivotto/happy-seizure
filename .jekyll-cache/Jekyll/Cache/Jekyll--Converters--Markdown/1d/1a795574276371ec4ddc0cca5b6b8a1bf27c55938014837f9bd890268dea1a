<p>I didnâ€™t think it was going to be possible, but 2010 slaughtered 2009. Almost everything that occurred had a pretty large degree of being unplanned or straying from how it was meant to turn out, and it still wound up being a much better year than I could have imagined. I have to say the â€˜winging itâ€™ approach to life has been working out pretty good for me.</p>
