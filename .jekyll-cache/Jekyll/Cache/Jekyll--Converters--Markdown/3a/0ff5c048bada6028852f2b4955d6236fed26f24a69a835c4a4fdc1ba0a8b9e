I"ˆ<p>Yesterday I was required down at the Channel 7 store (next to their Martin Place studios) to help setup and look over an Andre Reiu instore signing. Set my alarm for around 5:30/5:45 so that I could get myself ready and make my way through the morning traffic to be there by 7:30 in the morning.</p>

<p>Anyway, olâ€™ mate Rieu was doing an instore signing so I had to be on hand to make sure the crowd of 50+ year-olds didnâ€™t get too rowdyâ€¦ They can be a crazy lot! The dude is a force unto himself though, he even has his own entourage! Thereâ€™s a handful of dudes in suits following him round everywhere (not to mention his motorcade of 3 cars!) and theyâ€™re there to make sure everything is spot on for the guy.</p>

<p>No joke, they were even checking the supplied markers to make sure they had enough ink! And the way they were rushing the old ladies through the line, trying to get them in an out as quick as possible, man theyâ€™re like a well-oiled machine and there was NOTHING that they werenâ€™t making sure they had control ofâ€¦ If one thing didnâ€™t go to plan theyâ€™d probably lose their shit I reckon.</p>

<p>And today I was out finishing off buying my mate Scottyâ€™s bday present and went to buy him some scotch. While at the shop I saw this bottle of beer that had me intrigued and decided to pick one up for myself:</p>

<p>Not a bad drop, has a bit of a fruity flavour to it. Exxy though, $4 a bottle or $15 for a 4(!!!) pack.</p>
