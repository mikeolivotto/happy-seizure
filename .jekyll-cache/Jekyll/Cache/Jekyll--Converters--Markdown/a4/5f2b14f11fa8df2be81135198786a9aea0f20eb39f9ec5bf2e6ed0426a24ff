I"*<p>Three months in Sydney had passed and I was ready to get back to my Canadian life. Life in Sydney wasnâ€™t terrible though. Getting to hang with family and fiends again was the major upside to being back. Discovering my old work were in need of some help and me being in need of money, things worked out swell there, too. In fact, I was pretty much offered a job on my own terms; full time, part time, sales or customer service, whatever I wanted. Work was simple, fun and offered on a silver platter. Life was good, but I still missed the North.</p>
