I"Ü<p>Headed to Prague tomorrow. Itâ€™s just a stopover for me as I make my way down to Italy. It would be great to spend more time there, everyone says it awesome, but hey thereâ€™s always next time!</p>

<p>Big day for us yesterday, we visited the Sachsenhausen concentration camp which is about 45 mins out of Berlin. I said earlier that Amsterdam was an eye-opener, but that had nothing on Sachsenhausen, even if it is on a whole other level completely. Really sad reading about (and seeing) all the stuff the prisoners went through. Really depressing but definitely interesting to get a glimpse at it all. We spent the best part of 4 hours there and still didnâ€™t see it all. Must have been a horrible, horrible place during operation.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon we went down to Checkpoint Charlie, the main crossing point between East and West Berlin during the cold warâ€¦ itâ€™s all been reconstructed these days, but lots of information around the place on the significance of the checkpoint and a whole bunch of information about attempted escapes and other significant eventsâ€¦ Pretty boring for me to type about and even the pictures would look dull so I wonâ€™t bother with it much more, but if you find yourself in Berlin its well worth the visit.</p>

<p>To round 0ff the day we went to the Bang Bang Club to catch The Lucksmiths, some Melbourne band drew was keen to see (especially since theyâ€™re breaking up). Pretty funny night, drew drank 3 beers and vomited, the main support act seriously had to be the worst band I have ever seen in my life, and The Lucksmiths apparently donâ€™t appreciate hecklersâ€¦ ha! Came back to the hostel, Drew virtually immediately passed out in our room and Ash and I played pool till about 3 in the AM. Lots of fun and shenanigans.</p>

<p>Today was pretty chill, barely did anything, good change of pace. Actually Iâ€™ve spent way too much time in this cafe trying to post pictures to this blog its just so time consuming.</p>

<p>Oh, forgot to mention I <strong>finally</strong> got to have a beer at a maccas. Little did we realise (until it was already purchased) that it was 0.0% alcohol and tasted like filthy water. Horrible, but hey, I can say Iâ€™ve had a beer at maccas. Speaking of which, the beer selection here is humungous, and the beers are delicious. Mmmm.</p>
