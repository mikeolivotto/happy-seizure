I"X<p>Ok so I’m in much better spirits than yesterday.</p>

<p>The day yesterday didn’t quite go as planned, missed a bunch of bands, added to the fact it was cold and grey…<br />
Blackhole were pretty good, looking forward to seeing them again today, Set Your Goals sounded HUGE even though I did only see 2 songs, and I managed to catch a bit of NFG, Devil Sold His Soul, Four Year Strong, Against Me! and Alkaline Trio.</p>

<p>This morning I went for a bit of a walk down to London Bridge… I seem to remember an old nursery rhyme about it, but I was pretty disappointed when it was neither a pile of rubble, nor falling down. And there was no fair lady either. Come to think of it, it looked structurally sound last time I was in London too. Jipped!</p>

<p>At the moment I’m on the train up to Leeds for the same festival with Tim. Comfy train, free internets and drinking beers. Pretty rad times:</p>

  Tim&#8217;s been killing himself laughing at Rodney Rude on his ipod. It&#8217;s fair quiet in here, then he will burst out laughing&#8230; he has me crying with laughter at him.

  And also taking advantage of easy-to-find Dr Pepper. Drew, jealous?

  Will probably update this tomorrow on the train back to London&#8230; Might film some bands or something. Might not either. This is my blog, I will do whatever the hell I want.
