I"m<p>Been enjoying an amazing weekend. Kicked it off on Friday night with the work crew at the bar across from the office, and in a moment of alcohol-aided revelation, it finally hit me what kind of project I want to start. I also apparently had some interesting thing to say to Mel on msn, I plead not guilty. Gonna miss that kid when sheâ€™s gone for 2 months.</p>
