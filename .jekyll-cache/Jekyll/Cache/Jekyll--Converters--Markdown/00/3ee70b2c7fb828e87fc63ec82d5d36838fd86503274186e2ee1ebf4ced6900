I"Ù<p>I decided I needed to jump on the bandwagon and get me one of these blogs. I tried it once before but got bored with it and never really used it, but since I have an awesome trip coming up it seems as good an excuse as any to create one.</p>

<p>When I get some more time Iâ€™ll wind up using my domain name(s) to reach this blogâ€¦ www.happyseizure.com and/or www.mikeolivotto.com.</p>

<p>So about this trip, Iâ€™m headed off on an epic round-the-world tour, mostly taking in Europe and North America, and catching a load of music while Iâ€™m at it. It started out, way back last October, as a little bit of a half-hearted agreement with an old friend of mine now living in England that Iâ€™d come visit and go to Glastonbury Festival with himâ€¦ and at about 2am in the morning tiredness got the better of me as I put down a deposit on a ticket.</p>

<p>So far the lineup is only partially announced, but from what I hear the lineup isnâ€™t even half the experience of that festival so Iâ€™m pretty stoked for it. The bill currently includes Lily Allen, Neil Young, Blur, Bruce Springsteen, Echo And The Bunnymen, White Lies, and Kasabian to name a few.</p>

<p>After telling Drew my plans he thought it was a great idea and decided heâ€™d tag along. Anyway, to cut a long story short Iâ€™ll be hanging out with Drew (and Ash who he invited along) as well for 2 or 3 weeks. Along with Glasto, weâ€™re going to watch the amps get turned up to 11 as we enter Wembley Stadium for the one and only Spinal Tap(!!!), then onto Belgium for Rock Werchter Festival.</p>

<p>Rock Werchter you ask? Try this for a lineup:</p>

<p>â€¦and thatâ€™s not even half of it! (admittedly I did leave out <em>most</em> of the junk on there)</p>

<p>From there, the basic plan is to head over to Amsterdam, over to Berlin then up to Stockholm, at which point Drew and Asho will make their way to Russia. I then make off for several weeks on my own adventure where I plan on maybe going down to Rome via Munich, perhaps back up to Milan through to somewhere in Switzerland (Lucerne or Bern maybe?), then to Paris.</p>

<p>With my round-the-world ticket I have to get back to London to catch a flight to Quebec, and I will continue the journey through Montreal, Toronto and Chicago, flying back home via San Franâ€¦ Somewhere in there I plan to try and get along to see the Warped Tour and maybe, just maybe if Iâ€™m lucky Iâ€™ll get to see the reunited Blink 182 and/or Weezer.</p>

<p>All this in a period of around 7-8 weeks, provided the exchange rate doesnâ€™t wipe out my savings after a week. Cannot wait!</p>
