I"î	<p>The story at hand is about <strong>Moneen</strong> and their upcoming UK tour. June 22, The Barfly in Camden (London) with <strong>Lights Action</strong>! and <strong>Sharks</strong>. And itâ€™s a relatively cheap night too, only Â£7 (~$15). Itâ€™s gonna be grand, hopefully Iâ€™ll finally get to see them play a full, uninterrupted set for onceâ€¦ In Canada I missed most of their set trying to find my seats, supporting Alexisonfire in Sydney they were plagued by technical difficulties, Soundwave this year I had to miss a bit of themÂ to catch some of the other bands playing and then I missed them play atÂ their sideshow.</p>

<p>Speaking of Soundwave sideshows hereâ€™s a photo of Kenny (singer from Moneen) and I after the Alkaline Trio / Saves The Day / Rival Schools gig at the Manning Bar:</p>

<p>Iâ€™m really not good at this blogging thing, I donâ€™t think I have made a single post yet that I havenâ€™t edited at least 2-3 times with changes or more informationâ€¦ This section is one of those additions, I forgot to mention that the <strong>Glastonbury lineup</strong> was announced the other day and it is AMAZING! Checkout <a href="http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/" target="_blank">the full lineup</a>Â to see what Iâ€™m talking about, but if you canâ€™t be bothered (and I donâ€™t really blame you, truth is this blog is really just for me to look back on in future) hereâ€™s a sample of the awesomeness:<br />
