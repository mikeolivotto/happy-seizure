I"f<p>After 12 or so hours from Vancouver to Shanghai, I jumped on a domestic flight up to Xi’an to start this epic journey of mistranslations and mystery foods.</p>

<p>Day 1 got off to an interesting start, when I jumped in a cab armed with directions to my hostel only to find out the driver had no idea where I wanted to go because the address was in an english translation of what locals only understand in Chinese characters. After googling some more information I found an address in Chinese that the driver was confident he could get me to. Getting there in one piece was another story altogether; driving at speeds of up to 140 km/h while on the phone, darting in and out of lanes weaving traffic, and funnily enough the closest we came to an accident was driving down a back street at 5km/h whilst lost trying to look for the hostel.</p>

<p>Since this is the first of many* blogs to come from the next 2 months of travel I should probably introduce the main characters in the story. First up there is the handsome protagonist:</p>

</p>

<p>Then there is the couple:</p>

    The little one is Anna, she's our interpreter. The tall one is Damien, and he is pretty cool.

<p>Last up is our quasi-american hombre, Dave Jasek:</p>

    ...but he hasn't even joined the trip yet, so forget about him for the moment.
  </p>

<p>After a good night’s rest we spent the next day taking in the sights of the city, namely the city wall which Damien tells me is the largest in the world. I don’t really know, but I’m going to run with that. It’s about 13 or so kms around, and we rode all the way around that sucka.</p>

<p>Later in the day we went to visit the Wild Goose Pagoda with a massive water fountain out the front. Anna tried to wade through it, until a guard angrily kept blowing his whistle at her… he didn’t seem too impressed. Nice area to visit anyways.</p>

<p>Also for no reason at all, here’s Anna and I with the Eiffel Tower:</p>
