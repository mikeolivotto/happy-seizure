7 â€“ <strong>Burning Empires</strong> @ Spectrum<br />
Really good show. Band made up of guys from Misery Signals + drummer from Fall Out Boy</p>

<p>8 â€“ <strong>The Temper Trap</strong>, Bridezilla @ Enmore Theatre<br />
Show was packed. Was an ok set, but nowhere near as good as I remember at Glastonbury. The support, Bridezilla, were really snoozeworthy, actually almost fell asleep. Had a post-show party with guys from work &amp; Liberation.</p>

<p>9 â€“ <strong>Black Joe Lewis &amp; The Honeybears</strong> @ Martin Place (part of Sydney Festival First Night)<br />
I donâ€™t remember them being all that good at Lollapalooza, but this set was loads of fun, even if the night was incredibly hot.</p>
