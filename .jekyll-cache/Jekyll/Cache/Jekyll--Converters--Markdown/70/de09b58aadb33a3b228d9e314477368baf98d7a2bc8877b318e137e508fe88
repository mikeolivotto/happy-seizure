I"-<p>Work’s been a little better recently, night shifts still suck but I’m getting used to the long days plus I’ve also got enough time every day to get in about 45-60 mins of snowboarding which takes the edge off a little bit. I still haven’t broken anything, or at least not any bones… Put a dirty big crack in my googles yesterday after an elegant face plant, though I only actually noticed the crack when I took the goggles off to look at them. Maybe it was just my ugly mug that cracked them?</p>

<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day on the hill, I tried to take some video while snowboarding so you can see the kinds of views you get from up there on a nice day… It’s mostly just of me slowly going down the hill, with the camera angled off to the side at pretty much nothing, but I wasn’t really keen to go flying down the hill while holding my camera. You start seeing a bit of the scenery overlooking downtown Vancouver about halfway through. Looks pretty rad in real life.</p>

<p>Heading back up to Vernon/SilverStar to spend new years with Bee and Allie, somehow managed to organise a long weekend for myself so I could get there…</p>

<p>Also the Australian crew at work are already working on Australia Day plans (looks like the Australian contingent of the Lift Operations team will be conspicuously absent that day), and I am working on heading back to Seattle in early February. Or maybe Portland. We’ll see what happens as time gets closer.</p>

<p>This everlasting holiday rules.</p>
