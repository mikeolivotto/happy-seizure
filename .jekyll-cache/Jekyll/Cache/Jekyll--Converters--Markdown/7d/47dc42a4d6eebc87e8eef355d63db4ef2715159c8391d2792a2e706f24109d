I"¤<p>Itâ€™s easy to dump on North Korea â€“ officially the Democratic Peopleâ€™s Republic of Korea â€“ what with their <a title="Cult of Personality" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea's_cult_of_personality" target="_blank">self-obsessed leaders</a> and <a title="North Korea calls Switzerlandâ€™s refusal to sell it ski lifts a â€˜serious human rights abuseâ€™" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/10/07/north-korea-calls-switzerlands-refusal-to-sell-it-ski-lifts-a-serious-human-rights-abuse/" target="_blank">hilarious rhetoric</a>, though these would be fairly superficial reasons to hate on the place. Much has been written about the terrible things that go on within the Hermit Kingdom, and while no tour into the country will ever show the true dark side of life there, itâ€™s when you read between the lines and look beyond the faÃ§ade that a visit there becomes truly discomforting.</p>
