I"@<p>Went for a quick ride out to Roskilde… Didn’t know if there was much there aside from a Viking Museum (pretty badass in itself, so naturally I had to check it out), and after having been there I can confirm no, no there isn’t much there aside from a Viking Museum. As such, I have only 3 photos to show you</p>
