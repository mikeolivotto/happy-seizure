I"ß<p>Iâ€™ve been to Los Angeles a few times before, mainly for the super touristy adventures of theme parks and beaches, but I never was enamoured with the city in the same way some of my friends are. Itâ€™s sprawling and dense, busy, overpopulated, and always felt a little fake. Needless to say, itâ€™s been very low on my list of places to re-visit so when I made a relatively impulse decision to go on a short getaway, LA was somewhat of a begrudged choice of destination.</p>
