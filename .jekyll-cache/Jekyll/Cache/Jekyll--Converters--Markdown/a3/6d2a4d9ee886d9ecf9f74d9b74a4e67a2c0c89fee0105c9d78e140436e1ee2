I"/<p>Yesterday I was required down at the Channel 7 store (next to their Martin Place studios) to help setup and look over an Andre Reiu instore signing. Set my alarm for around 5:30/5:45 so that I could get myself ready and make my way through the morning traffic to be there by 7:30 in the morning.</p>
