I"<p>Kinda feel like I’ve been hit by a truck at the moment. Head is congested as anything and my nose won’t stop running so I’m currently dosing up on cold and flu tablets.</p>

<p>It has probably been brought on by the long and ridiculously hot days here in Denver but I’ve been having a pretty good time. Warped Tour was good fun, mid afternoon showers helped to cool the day down a bit, and the whole show wound up by about 8pm or so. Don’t think I could have held out much longer anyway, even if I tried.</p>

<p>Bands I saw:<br />
Fake Problems<br />
Parkway Drive<br />
Anti-Flag<br />
Reel Big Fish<br />
Andrew WK<br />
Dillinger Escape Plan<br />
Terrible Things<br />
Of Mice And Men<br />
Far From Finished<br />
The Casualties<br />
Suicide Silence<br />
Set Your Goals<br />
The Jukebox Romantics<br />
Riverboat Gamblers<br />
Dropkick Murphys<br />
Alkaline Trio<br />
Face To Face<br />
Pennywise<br />
Every Time I Die</p>

<p>Highlights included ETID covering Tourettes (Nirvana) and Bill Stevenson doing backup vocals on Pennwise’s ‘Society’.</p>

    Also learned Chuck Ragan was doing a set later that night at Only Thunder&#8217;s farewell show. $8, I couldn&#8217;t argue with that&#8230; The first 2 bands were pretty lame, Chuck was decent (and even brought Tim from Rise Against out to sing on one song). I wanted to see Only Thunder but it was already midnight by the time Chuck finished and as I mentioned I&#8217;ve been feeling pretty dodgy.

    Leaving for Albuquerque tonight, going to be in the deep south for the best part of the next week or so. But for now I&#8217;m about to go to the movies to kill some time (I have 5.5 hours before the bus leaves). Here&#8217;s one last picture of Denver:
