I"<p>So I don’t really have time for a proper update, and definitely no time for photos, but here’s a quick wrap up; AMAZING!</p>

<p>Glastonbury has to be seen to be believed! It was easily my best festival experience ever. Very chilled out atmosphere, a great selection of bands… just yesterday I saw everything from Status Quo to Brand New, Tom Jones to Blur (They were all incredible, I might add, and I’m serious about that).</p>

<p>Weather was about as good as we could have hoped for. Nice and dry for our setting-up as well as packing up, but a few small showery patches on Saturday night and early this morning.</p>

<p>Lots of photos were taken, lots of beers were had (probably in reverse order actually).</p>

<p>Blah, not enough time to really explain it all… I’ll be back with a much more awesome post with sweet photos in the next day or two hopefully!</p>

<p>Spinal Tap tomorrow night, fly to Brussels on Wednesday and Rock Werchter begins Thursday, so another 4 or 5 nights of camping.</p>

<p>and I’m off!</p>
