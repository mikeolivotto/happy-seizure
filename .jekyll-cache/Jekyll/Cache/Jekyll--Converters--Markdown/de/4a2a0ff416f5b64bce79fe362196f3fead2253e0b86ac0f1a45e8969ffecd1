I"«<p>Chilling around Vancouver airport waiting for my flight to leave. Had to throw out a bunch of clothes and my backpack is still super stuffed. Anyways Iâ€™m not going to have my phone active for a while so just email me if you have to. Iâ€™ll get around to it at some point.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll post some Seattle photos later too.</p>

<p>Kinda bummed to be leaving Vancouver. Looking forward to being back later in the year.</p>
