    So I&#8217;ve picked up some German&#8230;

<p>A few cool things have happened since I last checked in with you allâ€¦ went on a <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0727.jpg">canal cruise</a> through Amsterdam and saw a lot of things that seemed cool at the time â€“ like the <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0730.jpg">7 bridges</a> â€“ but post-tour you wonder why the hell you took photos of some stuffâ€¦ still, was a good way to checkout the city all from the comfort of a seat. I like not walking. And especially not having to carry a backpack.</p>

<p>We did a few more typicalÂ AmsterdamÂ things; went to the Van Gogh museum (hereâ€™s where I mention Drew and Ash got of the tram, then the driver closed the door before I could even get off. Bastard.), took a photo of myself <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0731.jpg">standing on a giant Amsterdam sign</a>, went to the <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0733.jpg">Heinekin brewery</a>, <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0751.jpg">slept in a giant clog</a>, drank some beers, and <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0757.jpg">cut up my hand in a restaurant</a>. Good times!</p>

<p>But back to the Heinekin Brewery. Here, have a few photos:</p>

<p>The morning we caught the train to Berlin we did some basic grocery shopping for supplies to keep our bellies full on the 6-hour ride at which point I came across a giant ball of cheese. Oh yes, the signalling of the Summer of George (oh how I wanted to <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0759.jpg">bite into that cheese like it was an apple</a>).</p>

<p>That was yesterday, and I could begin to feel my throat give me a big middle-finger salute. I think Iâ€™m coming down with the swine, my nose is running like a tap and it feels like Iâ€™ve been munching on fibreglass. Good times.</p>

<p>We went for a stroll and came across my <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0761.jpg">European amigos</a>,Â and then made a bee-line for the wall. AÂ couple cool photos for you:</p>

<p>I guess this is <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0764-1.jpg">The Berlin Wall</a><br />

<p>Today we went to the zoo, home to the famous polar bear Knut. Lots of cool animals here, lots of awesome pictures, Iâ€™ll detail this section when I get some more time. Had a pretty decent giant pretzel (to be honest it could have been better), even saw <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0830.jpg">dad</a>, and a few <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/amsterdamandgermany/IMG_0827.jpg">rangas</a> ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>Looks like weâ€™re no longer doing Stockholm (too much of a pain in the butt to get too, way too far from anywhere I want to go after it too). Thinking maybe Prague, or Munich, or who knows, maybe Iâ€™ll just jump a random train and explore wherever it arrives.</p>
