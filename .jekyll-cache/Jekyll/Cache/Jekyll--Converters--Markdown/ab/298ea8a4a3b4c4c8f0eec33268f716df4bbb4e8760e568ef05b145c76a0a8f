I"ú<p>Some people have bucket lists, life achievements or activities they want to ensure are crossed off before they kick the bucket. That seemed boring to me, so I decided to narrow it down to the next year or two. Or 5. Iâ€™ll keep extending it when I realise I have no chance of accomplishing it in a particular timeframe.</p>

<p>The rules? None really, other than to just do things in the most interesting, out there or oddball ways possible.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll add to the list later, but hereâ€™s a starter:<br />
See 100 gigs/shows/festivals in 2010<br />
Live overseas for at least 12 months<br />
Visit japan<br />
Go to the Fest in Florida<br />
Drive coast to coast in the USA<br />
Bungee jump<br />
Put on a gig<br />
Play in a band<br />
Another piercing<br />
Swim in the atlantic ocean<br />
See some American sports â€“ nba, baseball, nfl, hockey, etc<br />
Wind up in the local media of somewhere overseas (ie. Make your way into a news item on tv/in the newspaper/etc, or get interviewed/photographed)</p>
