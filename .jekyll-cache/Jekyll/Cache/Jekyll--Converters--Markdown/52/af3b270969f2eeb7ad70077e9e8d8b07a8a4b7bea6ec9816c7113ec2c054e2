    I&#8217;m hitting up Bern in Switzerland at the moment.

<p>After Berlin Ash and Drew decided on Prague and since everyone seems to rant and rave on about that place I figured I may as well come for the ride and at least overnight there. So maybe Iâ€™m missing the point, but honestly Prague has been the biggest let down so far. For a place everyone hypes up it really just seemed like any other European city without any of itâ€™s own real personality. In the night Ash, Drew and I went out and got dinner. <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/praguemunichbern/IMG_0937.jpg">BEST DINNER EVER</a>. Full of pork with a side of red cabbage sauerkraut.</p>

<p>I was hoping to fly directly from Prague to Venice or Rome but flights were stupidly expensive and complicated (long stopovers) so I settled for hitting up Munich instead. I did always want to go there but I figured it just wasnâ€™t going to happen with everything else I wanted to do but you know what, Iâ€™m glad my plans buggered up and that I had to â€˜settleâ€™ on going there instead of Venice (for the moment anyway). Munich is easily the best city Iâ€™ve been to so far, itâ€™s <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/praguemunichbern/IMG_0960.jpg">beautiful</a>, has plenty of <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/praguemunichbern/IMG_0955.jpg">character</a> and thereâ€™s just so much to see and do.</p>

<p>I arrived in Munich pretty much homeless. And I also discovered 4:30 in the afternoon, in the middle of Summer, is not a good time to try and find a hostel. All were booked up so I had to settle for one of the cheapest hotels I could findâ€¦ You would think it would be a welcome change from a hostel,Â but for my first night away from my pals I was kinda looking forward to making friends. Oh well!Â The afternoon I got there I did what I normally do and checked out the city by foot. No idea how far I walked, but I was gone for a good 5-6 hours and my feet were done for!</p>

<p>The next day I rentedÂ the <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/praguemunichbern/IMG_0983.jpg">coolestÂ bike ever</a> and decided to explore things that way and give my feet a rest. I pretty much just picked a direction and rode as far as I could until I hit something interestingâ€¦ I came across the zooâ€¦ didnâ€™t go in but I could see a <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/praguemunichbern/IMG_0978.jpg">few things from the side of the road</a>. around the area is a big river and <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/praguemunichbern/IMG_0979.jpg">lots of trees</a>, almost forest likeâ€¦ Was good fun just being out of the city. Came back to the hostel later in the afternoon and came across Jo, a girl we all met on the train to Prague who also stayed in our hostel there. Found out about a Beer Challenge and decided to head along to it. Very fun night. Very hazy too.</p>

<p>That about brings us to today. Caught a 7am train to Bern (waking up has never been so hard!) and damn the scenery is picturesque through Bavaria down to the Swiss Alps. Itâ€™s just so goddamn beautiful. Speaking of the alps, Iâ€™ve been noticing Iâ€™ve been getting way puffed out walking up here, particularly with the steep hills I have to scale.</p>

<p>Anyway thereâ€™s a pretty <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/mikezero/praguemunichbern/IMG_1007.jpg">fast flowing river</a> through here and you can jump in one end, and about a kilometre or two downstream you wind up at the free public poolsâ€¦ It was awesomely refreshing, particularly on a day like today which I think was low to mid 30â€™s.</p>

<p>Loving every minute of this place, definitely a place I want to come back to in future, would love to see Lucerne too but canâ€™t do it all, right? Tomorrow night I think Iâ€™ll catch an overnight train into Venice. Gonna be rad!</p>
