I"ã<p>Iâ€™ve had to remind myself recently that things going wrong make for some of the best travel stories as some kind of consolation for having been robbed in Mexico a few weeks back. Itâ€™s a drama filled story and does serve as a good travel battle story, but for now as Iâ€™m without photos I think I should try and retell the final few weeks of my Europe adventure before the memories fade. Stories of Mexico (and an entire North American trip) will be told in coming posts.</p>
