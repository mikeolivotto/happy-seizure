I"þ<p>Workâ€™s been a little better recently, night shifts still suck but Iâ€™m getting used to the long days plus Iâ€™ve also got enough time every day to get in about 45-60 mins of snowboarding which takes the edge off a little bit. I still havenâ€™t broken anything, or at least not any bonesâ€¦ Put a dirty big crack in my googles yesterday after an elegant face plant, though I only actually noticed the crack when I took the goggles off to look at them. Maybe it was just my ugly mug that cracked them?</p>
