I"^<p>I was planning to catch an overnight and wake up in Venice tomorrow but when I went to reserve a seat I discovered everything was booked up, even the expensive seats! Not happy about that, now I have to leave Bern at about 4pm and get into Venice around 10:30pm. Finding accommodation for there was also a hassle but Iâ€™ve got it sorted now.</p>
