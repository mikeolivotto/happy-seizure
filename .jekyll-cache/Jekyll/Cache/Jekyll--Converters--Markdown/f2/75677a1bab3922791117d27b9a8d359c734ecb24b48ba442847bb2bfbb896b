I"z<p>When I was in Whistler by myself Bee mentioned she’d like to get up there sometime, and considering my trip up there was on one of the most miserable weekends ever I figured it’d be good to go again since it couldn’t be any worse, and going hiking would be more fun with a friend. So that’s what happened, we organised to head up together the very next weekend.</p>
