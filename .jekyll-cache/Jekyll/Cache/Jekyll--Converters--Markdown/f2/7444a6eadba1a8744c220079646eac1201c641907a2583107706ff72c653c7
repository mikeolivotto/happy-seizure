I"<p>I’m just going to put it out there, but Venice kind of sucks. It’s interesting for an hour or two, after which point you realise it’s just annoyingly crowded with tourists and thus everything is priced to match their fat wallets. That said I was just a little more than excited to be somewhere familiar (and where I had at least <em>some</em> understanding of the language) for the first time in about a month and a half. Coincidentally we flew in one year to the day that I flew out of Venice last year.</p>
