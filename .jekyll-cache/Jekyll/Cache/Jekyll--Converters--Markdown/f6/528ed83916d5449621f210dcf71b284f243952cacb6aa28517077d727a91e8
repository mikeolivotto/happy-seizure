I"O<p>Went on a bit of a trek through the mountains in Banff by myself while Bee was back at work. Pretty chill day, went up to the Cave and Basin where some railroad workers discovered the hot sulphur springs back in the late 1880â€™s. The cave and basin were actually closed for renovations, but I still managed to snap a few pics.</p>
