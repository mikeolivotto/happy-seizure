I"w<p>It’s been a little over a week now that the ‘couver has been my home, slowly getting myself organised with all that really fun stuff like a Social Insurance Number, bank account, local cell phone number and all those kinds of goodies. Other than that, it’s been a really chilled out time so far, lots of sleep ins, seeing bands, and cooking myself meals fit for a king… a king who can’t really cook very well. I think I attempted my most complex meal ever last night, pumpkin and mushroom risotto. If you like your rice a little crunchy with a slight burnt… <em>flavour</em> through your risotto, then it ruled!</p>
