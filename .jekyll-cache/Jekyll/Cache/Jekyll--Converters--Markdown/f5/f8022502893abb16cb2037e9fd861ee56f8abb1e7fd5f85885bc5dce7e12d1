I"™<p>Iâ€™ve been using skyscanner a lot to find flights in and around Europe, and last night I used it to search a connection from Edinburgh to London. I found a flight right away, with BMI, and for a measly Â£40 ($80). Stoked!</p>

<p>So I get to the airport and the self check-in kiosk isnâ€™t recognising my bookingâ€¦ go and get some help and what do you know, Iâ€™ve booked a flight for September 26!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve noticed before that Skyscanner defaults to 2 months after the current date, except last night I somehow forgot this and away I bookedâ€¦ Anyway, all sorted now, after an extra Â£80 ($160). Couldnâ€™t really do anything but laugh at my stupidity.</p>

<p>Had a great time here in Edinburgh, typical wet/cold weather, then blue skies and heat out of nowhereâ€¦ Went for a few walks around the place, saw street performers, climbed up Arthurâ€™s Seat (massive dormant volcano) and did a bunch of other stuff. I would post photos but Iâ€™m on the really expensive airport internet cafe.</p>

<p>So yeh, down to London tonight, hopefully finally getting to see Abbey Rd tomorrow morning then flying out to Quebec about midday tomorrrow.</p>

<p>Adios amigos!</p>
