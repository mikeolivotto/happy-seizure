<p>Iâ€™m just going to put it out there, but Venice kind of sucks. Itâ€™s interesting for an hour or two, after which point you realise itâ€™s just annoyingly crowded with tourists and thus everything is priced to match their fat wallets. That said I was just a little more than excited to be somewhere familiar (and where I had at least <em>some</em> understanding of the language) for the first time in about a month and a half. Coincidentally we flew in one year to the day that I flew out of Venice last year.</p>

<p>It was already dark by the time we rocked up, but thankfully we found the hostel pretty quickly and headed straight out to see some stuff.</p>

    Canal at night

<p>We were there just for the night so it was a bit of a whirlwind visit. We went and checked out San Marcoâ€™s Square and took photos of canals, and not all too surprisingly found ourselves lost on several occasions. Dave and I somehow walked in circles to the exact same bridge about three times in 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d already taken somewhere in the region of 3,457 photos last time I was in town so I <del>figured it was kind of pointless to take more photos of the same stuff</del> snapped loads more becauseâ€¦ Iâ€™m not really sure why.</p>

<p>Tucked away in some little alley we came across an interesting little art gallery, home to a statue of a dude with the severed head of Ronald McDonald along with a painting of Batman fondling Wonder Woman and a naked Marge Simpson. Sure, why not.</p>

  And that&#8217;s the story of Venice.
