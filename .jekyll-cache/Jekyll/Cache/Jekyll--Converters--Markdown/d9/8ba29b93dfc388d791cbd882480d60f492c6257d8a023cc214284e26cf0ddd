I"Ì<p>Just booked flights to China for the end of April. Planning on a pretty kick ass trip with Damien, Dave and Anna, starting in China to skate through the Great Wall like some kind of Tony Hawk / David Copperfield hybrid, take on an army of clay soldiers, and then to Mongolia, which my main knowledge of comes from South Park telling me they have warriors consistently trying to burn down city walls with sweet &amp; sour sauce. Sounds destructalicious.</p>
