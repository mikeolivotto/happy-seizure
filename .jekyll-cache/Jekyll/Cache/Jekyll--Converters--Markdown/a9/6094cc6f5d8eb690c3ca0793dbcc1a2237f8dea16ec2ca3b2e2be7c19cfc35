  Literally.
  Headed up to SilverStar Mountain to be of entertainment to Bee and Allie, and to kill some more time before I had to start work. The cold snap just came from snow where and it bucketed down for most of the time I was there. We forked out a few dollars for some kids snow toys and had loads of fun shredding down snowy hills until we got told off by uptight security.
