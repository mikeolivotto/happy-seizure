I"g<p>I would update this thing proper if the hotel internet didn’t suck.</p>

<p>I’m at the Fest with Mel, it’s awesome. Florida has been good, we’ve done Wet N Wild, Universal Studios and eaten at Taco Bus. Yes, a bus that sells Mexican food. It was incredible.</p>

<p>So that’s all the update you get for now. Pictures and stories coming soon.</p>
