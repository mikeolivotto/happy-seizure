I"Ç.<p>Iâ€™ve been meaning to do this for a couple weeks now since I never did really get around to updating everyone on most of the Candian/American sector on the tripâ€¦</p>

<p>So I left off talking about the Blink 182 show in Milwaukee and 10 for $10 Tour. Hereâ€™s some pictures for you to have a bit of a geeze at:</p>

    After 10 for $10 I back-tracked my way to Chicago, taking about 5 or 6 hours to complete what is normally only a 2.5 hour trip. It was nice, I stopped off a few times along the way, even went to one of Michigan&#8217;s state parks to go for a swim in Lake Michigan. Beautiful day, great weather and the water was a great temperature. Driving into Chicago was a bit of a pain, the traffic there is insane.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The next day was the first of Lollapalooza and it just so happened that the car drop-off point was about 2 blocks from the festival, so it was nice to be able to drive myself to the festival pretty much. The whole 3 days were a bit of a blur to me, so I&#8217;m not even going to bother trying to write a blow-by-blow review, not that it would be all that interesting to read anyway&#8230;but there were a few observations I made:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      The festival felt like it had no real personality to it&#8230; Every other festival I can remember going to always seems to have something interesting to see or do other than watch music, even if it&#8217;s just market stalls or some kind of performance art&#8230; this festival had virtually none of that, just 8 stages spread across one huge park.
    </li>
    <li>
      They had people doing sign language to all the mainstage bands&#8230; seriously, what the hell?
    </li>
    <li>
      Grant Park is one huge mofo of a park. One end to the other (mainstage to mainstage) would take a good 10-15 minutes without battling your way past anyone.
    </li>
    <li>
      Perry Farrel still loves himself.
    </li>
  </ul>

      I don&#8217;t remember everything I saw, and I did see a lot of partial sets, but here&#8217;s what I can recall:

      All in all it was a pretty good weekend. Randomly made some friends with some people yelling at everyone to give them high-fives&#8230; We ended up walking through the streets of Chicago for a couple hours, grabbing a late night feed, trying to go for a swim in the pool at one of their siblings&#8217; block of apartments (indoor pool, doors locked after 11pm&#8230; nawww). Turned out to be such a fun night.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Chicago itself is pretty cool&#8230; Lots of cool things to see and explore, I was a little disappointed by Navy Pier but Millenium Park was pretty cool. As it turned out I didn&#8217;t really have as much time as I was hoping to have in Chicago, so I missed out on a few of the touristy things such as Lincoln Park Zoo, Sears Tower and Reckless Records (it was the store in High Fidelity). I suppose there&#8217;s always next time ðŸ™‚

        The flight to San Francisco with United Airways was a fun story as I&#8217;ve probably already told a few of you. Before I go on I must mention all my flights were booked through AirNZ as a round-the-world trip&#8230; Long story short I was told I had to go to the gate to get my &#8220;seat allocation&#8221; (ie. boarding pass). I do as I&#8217;m told and ask the people at the desk for my seat allocation, only to be told I can&#8217;t do that through them and I have to go talk to the Air New Zealand people&#8230; I go on a wild goose chase looking for Air New Zealand reps (which of there are none &#8211; AirNZ don&#8217;t fly to Chicago&#8230;), eventually go back to the United check in counter and explain the situation&#8230; After lots of arguing that, yes, I definitely went to the right check-in counter and I did nothing wrong, the check-in girl rings the gate only to find out the woman thought I was asking for a REceipt. Anyway, after this wild goose chase I went on I should have missed my flight, and the only saving grace was the flight was delayed by an hour. Very lucky indeed, and a stress I just did not need.

        San Francisco was amazing. Just as beautiful as I remember as a child and the perfect place to end my trip when I had a bit of money to burn. First day I got there was pretty funny, within 10 mins of venturing out of my hotel I managed to bump into some family friends who then had me around for dinner and then drove me to a gig I was going to that night&#8230; Was really nice to see some familiar faces again and have a good chat. The bands I saw were The Copyrights (who were really really fun) and Cobra Skulls (also very fun, but I&#8217;m not really into the who rockabilly thing).

        The next day I did the touristy stuff, walked to Pier 39 and saw the seals, then rented a bike and rode up to and across the Golden Gate Bridge. The weather was generally great that day but there was a lot of low-lying cloud that made the bridge almost impossible to see in the distance. I got mega sunburn that day&#8230; Later in the evening I went and bought myself a sexy new Fender P-bass&#8230; it&#8217;s only a mexi, but still looks and sounds sweet.

          The last morning I had I went and did what I had planned all along &#8211; to blow the last of my cash at Amoeba Music. 3.5 hours and around US$100 spent per hour, I came out with almost 30 CD&#8217;s and a generous handful of vinyl. Damn it was nice to go on a spree like that after being pretty conservative with what I bought for most of the trip. Spent so much time there I had only enough time to grab some lunch, pick up the skateboard I had been eyeing off the day before and get back to the hotel to catch the transfer to the airport.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The flights all went pretty smoothly, except when New Zealand security confiscated my skateboard because I was bringing it as carry on and it could be used as a weapon&#8230; despite the fact I had just come off TWO US-boarded flights with it as carry on. Thankfully it really wasn&#8217;t much of a big deal, I just spoke with some AirNZ staff who managed to check it in for me.

        <p>
          All&#8217;s well that ends well.
