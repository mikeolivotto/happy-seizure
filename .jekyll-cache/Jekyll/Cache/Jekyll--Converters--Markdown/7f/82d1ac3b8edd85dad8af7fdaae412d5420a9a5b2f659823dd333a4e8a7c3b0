I""<p>After having spent around 14 hours in Italy we started making our way towards Postojna (“Pos-toy-na”), about an hour over the Italian/Slovenian border. The idea was to try and spend a couple hours in Trieste on the way over, get one more fix of that sweet sweet Italian coffee and maybe check out the Roman ruins before moving on but a bit of misinformation from the internet (I’m shocked and appalled that the internet could be wrong, who’d have thought?!) meant we had maybe 45 mins to eat and make a connection to our next bus.</p>
