I"š<p>After month 2:</p>

<p>Number of trips = 13<br />
Total time spent travelling = approx 69 hours<br />
Cost of travel without the pass = $666</p>

<p>$1424 worth of travel on a $530 pass across the 2 monthsâ€¦ Pretty happy with that.<br />
And a total of 189 hours, or 7.875 days, spent on 26 bus trips over 2 months.</p>

<p>This post proves I have way too much time on my hands. Unemployment is great!</p>
