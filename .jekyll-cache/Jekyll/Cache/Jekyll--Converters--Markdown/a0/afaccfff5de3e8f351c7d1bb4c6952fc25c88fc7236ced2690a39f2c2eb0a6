  If you enjoy music of the punk rock persuasion, plaid flannel, beards, dive bars and an amazing sense of community with several thousand strangers, The Fest is the place for you. It&#8217;s a three day festival spread across 11 or so venues (everything from pubs to cafes and bookstores) that takes control of the college town of Gainesville, Florida for the Halloween weekend.
