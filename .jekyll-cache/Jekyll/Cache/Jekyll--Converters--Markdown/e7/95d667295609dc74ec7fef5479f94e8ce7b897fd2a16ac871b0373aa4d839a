  <em>* &#8230;The crowd screaming out the stinging final verse of &#8216;Monkey Wrench&#8217;, and Grohl, eyeing up one guy in the front row, saying, &#8220;Hey you down there, mouthing all the words&#8230; you want to get up and sing?&#8221; before dragging him up on stage. Unfortunately, the guy&#8217;s first attempt to dish out the final verse back-fired when he turned the mic off (doh), but a quick flick later, and he totally delivered under the pressure, spit-firing out the lyrics like a total pro, before leaping a good five metres through the air into the mosh pit in a moment of complete rock star glory. Dude, wherever you are, you passed Rock 101 with flying colours. m/</em>
