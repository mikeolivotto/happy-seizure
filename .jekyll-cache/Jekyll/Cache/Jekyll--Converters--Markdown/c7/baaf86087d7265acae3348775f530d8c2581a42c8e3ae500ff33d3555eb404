I"c<p>Got into leeds about 1 pm yesterday and from what I could tell it was a pretty cool little city and now I’m wishing I gave myself a bit more time to check it out. Today is the Bank Holiday though, so everything’s closed anyway… maybe not so much fun on a public holiday with everything closed, but I think I might have to come back sometime.</p>
