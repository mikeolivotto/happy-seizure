  So after who-knows-how-long my copy of <em>Common Existence</em> finally arrived at Beatdisc.

<p>Nice double LP even though there’s actually only 3 sides… the 4th is laser-etched with the dove logo and some lyrics, it actually looks pretty cool. And while on the subject Victory the other day announced a re-press of <em>Full Collapse</em> on brown. Needless to say I smacked the credit card down on that one as soon as I heard about it, the bummer is that it probably won’t actually arrive here before I go away. At least it will be like coming home to a present, by which time I’ll probably have forgotten ordering it anyway.</p>
