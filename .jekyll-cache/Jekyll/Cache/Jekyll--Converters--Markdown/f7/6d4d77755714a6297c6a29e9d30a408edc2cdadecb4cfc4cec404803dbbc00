  It&#8217;s bizarre how slight changes in the climate can make a huge difference in perception of the temperature. If it were to reach -10 at work I&#8217;d probably be wearing 7 or 8 layers and still be shaking like a Parkinson&#8217;s sufferer. This is about -12 in SilverStar and with the dry air of the area that t-shirt under the hoodie was enough.
