I"¨<p>By this point I had no idea where I was going or how I was getting there. I was running low on cash, but wanted to spend a couple more weeks in Europe. I had to fly home from Frankfurt, so I wanted to stay in that region of Europe, but I wanted to hang out in places I hadnâ€™t yet been. And add to that the fact I have an ongoing contest with Damien (at least in my own head) to notch up the most countries visited.</p>
