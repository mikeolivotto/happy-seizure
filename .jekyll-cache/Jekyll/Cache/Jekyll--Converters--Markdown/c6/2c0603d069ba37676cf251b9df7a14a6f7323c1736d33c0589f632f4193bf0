I"Á<p>If the post titles donâ€™t make a lot of sense its probably because theyâ€™re song lyricsâ€¦ This one is from <strong>Set Your Goals,</strong> I caught themÂ at the Manning Bar on Tuesday night and again last night with best bud Mel! Tuesday was probably the better show, they played a couple of new tracks and were sounding pretty good. Not the tightest band going but for what they lack they completely make up for with the party attitude.</p>
