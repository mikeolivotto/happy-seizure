I"‹<p>Itâ€™s been an interesting 24 hours, to say the leastâ€¦ Arriving in Dallas at 4am to ridiculous heat, pain and unable to hear out of one ear, spur of the moment decision to go to some regional town to see a band, getting dropped off in the middle of nowhere and discovering my phone was dead, and walking 6 kms (each way) to see a bunch of bands Iâ€™d never actually listened to before.</p>
