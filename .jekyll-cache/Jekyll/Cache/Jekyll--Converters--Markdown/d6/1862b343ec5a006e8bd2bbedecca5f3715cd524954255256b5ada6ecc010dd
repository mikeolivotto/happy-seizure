I"{<p>The story at hand is about <strong>Moneen</strong> and their upcoming UK tour. June 22, The Barfly in Camden (London) with <strong>Lights Action</strong>! and <strong>Sharks</strong>. And it’s a relatively cheap night too, only £7 (~$15). It’s gonna be grand, hopefully I’ll finally get to see them play a full, uninterrupted set for once… In Canada I missed most of their set trying to find my seats, supporting Alexisonfire in Sydney they were plagued by technical difficulties, Soundwave this year I had to miss a bit of them to catch some of the other bands playing and then I missed them play at their sideshow.</p>
