I"Y<p>Went up to Newcastle last night for the first show of the Samiam / A Death In The Family tour. The drive up there went so quickly, had some good company in Mel and Lyndall which helped. Grabbed some pizza (I devoured a pizza to myself, then ended up eating a few slices of the pizza the girls shared, plus some garlic bread). Beer munchies most likely.</p>

  A Death In The Family did reasonably well but there was no Mabo. No vibe. No constitution. The turnout didn&#8217;t seem all that great at the Cambridge so that was probably why. Samiam were great though, first half of the set was almost exclusively Astray and Whatever&#8217;s Got You Down songs and they nailed them. Looking forward to tonight and next weekend.
