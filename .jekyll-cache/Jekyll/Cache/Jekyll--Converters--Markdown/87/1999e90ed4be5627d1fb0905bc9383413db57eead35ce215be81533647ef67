<p>Wish theyâ€™d hurry up and announce some dates already.</p>

<p>In other news, last night I hit up Little Birdy at the Metro for their major album launch type gig. Was good, caught up with a few work people and friends, made a couple new ones and evenÂ Ellen made it out to the show for a bitâ€¦ which had its perks when it turned out she knew most the bar staff â€“ HELLO FREE DRINKS!</p>

<p>It was a bit of a work function last night, kind of a â€˜everyone-come-meet-the-label/band-weâ€™re-now-distributingâ€™ type deal so there was a kind ofÂ  â€˜afterpartyâ€™ (ie. free drinks and stand around and chat in the Metro foyer) and who should be there but olâ€™ pal Rob Gyro! Had a bit of a chat with him, drank some reeeeally strong drinks (again, blame Ellenâ€™s bar friends) and kicked on till about 1amâ€¦ not too bad an effort considering it was a school night.</p>

<p>Little bit buggered now though.</p>
