I"À<p>â€¦of trying to get a gig.</p>

<p>Damien sends me an email yesterday saying the Sandringham offered his band (The Camel Tigers) a gig in October, as long as he finds 3 bands to round out the bill.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not sure exactly why he thinks he needs my help but Iâ€™m pretty keen to help out, and I think itâ€™s kinda funny that Iâ€™ve tried organising my own gigs a couple times in the past and itâ€™s never workedâ€¦ this time though Iâ€™m not even trying and it seems like itâ€™s all pretty much organised within half a day.</p>

<p>Just waiting on a definite yes from one of the bands and then I guess itâ€™s all good to lock in. Look like itâ€™s going to be Sniperival, Kimbo (from Melbourne), Mr Vengeance (ex-Bagster guys) and of course Damienâ€™s band. Should be good!</p>

<p>On another note, the next few weeks are hugeâ€¦<br />
September:<br />
10 â€“ The Bronx / Mariachi el Bronx at The Metro<br />
12 â€“ Samiam in Newcastle<br />
13 â€“ Samiam at The Annandale<br />
18 â€“ Poison City Weekender night 1<br />
19 â€“ Samiam in Melbourne (PCW night 2)<br />
20 â€“ Samiam in Melbourne (PCW night 3)<br />
30 â€“ Bad Religion / NOFX / Pour Habit<br />
31 â€“ Pour Habit</p>

<p>I canâ€™t wait!</p>
