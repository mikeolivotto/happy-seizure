<p>No time for a real update. Montreal was a little disappointing (expected more from it, was just another city, reallyâ€¦ lots of street festivals going on though), and Toronto was amazingly awesome.</p>

<p>First night in Toronto I saw Rise Against (who were amazing!) and Rancid, the next I saw Cursive, and the day after that I toured Niagara Falls and then later saw Eagles Of Death Metal (first tiem they disappointed me liveâ€¦ sound was pretty bad).</p>

<p>Tonight Iâ€™m in Milwaukee after a 17 hour coach journey, about to see Blink182 on their reunion tour with Fall Out Boy and Panic At The Disco.</p>

<p>On to Grand Rapids, MI tomorrow for the hardcore â€™10 for $10 Tourâ€™â€¦ overnight there then over to Chicago to drop the car off and get ready for Lollapalooza.</p>

<p>Doing great, will catch you all soon!</p>
