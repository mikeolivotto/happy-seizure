I"_<p>Been enjoying an amazing weekend. Kicked it off on Friday night with the work crew at the bar across from the office, and in a moment of alcohol-aided revelation, it finally hit me what kind of project I want to start. I also apparently had some interesting thing to say to Mel on msn, I plead not guilty. Gonna miss that kid when she’s gone for 2 months.</p>

<p>Saturday morning the revelation was still there and pretty much the whole weekend I’ve been thinking about this project. World domination shall be mine next year.</p>

<p>So I’ve been spending the weekend finally kicking back to Nirvana’s Live At Reading DVD (every bit amazing as I hoped and dreamed), getting my way into Season 6 of Curb Your Enthusiasm, and discovering a load of bands. It’s been a bit of a geeky let’s-try-finding-new-stuff kind of weekend for me. Currently losing my shit to <a href="http://www.myspace.com/titlefight/">Title Fight</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t know why I wasn’t put onto these guys earlier, but they rule… I’ve also been giving <a href="http://www.myspace.com/manoverboardnj">Man Overboard</a> a bit of a listen. Not so convinced on them but they go alright for a bit of a casual listen.</p>

<p>Forgot to mention we had Lee Kernaghan come into work on Friday. Genuinely nice dude. We even wound up on his twitter:</p>
