I"M<p>Loads has happened in the past week since the last proper entry. I’ve been to (or through) Calgary 5 times, up to Edmonton, to Regina, to the badlands in Drumheller to see some sweet fossils, been snowed on, had consistent highs of around 7°C, had some little shit in Regina try to roll me and seen a bunch of sweet bands.</p>
