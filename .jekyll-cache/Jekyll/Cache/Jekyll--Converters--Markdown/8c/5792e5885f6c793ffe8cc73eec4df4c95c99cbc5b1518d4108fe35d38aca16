I"£<p>Siberia has not exactly lived up to expectations so far. Considering we came from a snowy Mongolia, it seemed odd to arrive to Irkutsk and be walking around comfortably in shorts and t shirts, but now 5 days later it started snowing on us againâ€¦ Still not cold enough to accumulate though, it all just melts as it hits the ground.</p>

<p>There are several other observations I have made about this place so far.</p>

<p>1) They seem to love all things Paris related. Hereâ€™s me with the Eiffel Tower:</p>

  2) There are lots of really neat old wooden houses just in amongst modern buildings, and often painted with different pastel shades. They look like something straight out of a movie set:

    Not the best example but you get the idea
  </p>

<p>3) It kinda looks like Leninâ€™s about to smack the back of some invisible personâ€™s head:</p>

  4) There is a sweet dragon welded out of junk around the corner from the hostel:

  5) Funky architecture:

  6) The Irkutsk flag design is pretty badical:

<p style="text-align:left;">
  We made a small side trip for a couple days over to Olkhon Island, the world&#8217;s 3rd largest lake-bound island on Lake Baikal, home to the world&#8217;s only fresh water seals. Hurrah for nature! We were promised a hovercraft ride to get over to the island because the ice was too thick for boats but not thick enough to support a vehicle. On the list of &#8220;totally awesome stuff 8-yr old Damo, Dave and Mike will lose their shit over,&#8221; hovercrafts are ranking pretty high up there, probably just behind the Simpsons. And dinosaurs, can&#8217;t forget dinosaurs.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  No hovercraft ever appeared, so I have to say I am very dissapoint. And sorry. Much like the Russian guy who took a disliking to me because after asking me something in Russian I responded with &#8220;sorry, no Russian&#8221; as I continued walking&#8230; but that&#8217;s a story for another day.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  We stayed at a pretty sweet homestead with log cabins and wood fires, had all our meals cooked for us and a great place to just relax and do a lot of nothing (because let&#8217;s face it, we all live such stressful lives!).

  I&#8217;ve been feeling a little under the weather lately, a bit of nausea mixed with the flu so I spent most of my time sleeping. I did try and head out a few times to checkout the place and I have to say it was some of the prettiest scenery I&#8217;ve ever come across (as per usual, waaaaaaaaaaaaay better in real life).

  We even went swimming in there at one point. Probably not good for my health since I was already fluey, but screw health, you only live once.

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Also, Damien plays a ukelele. Astonishingly well.
