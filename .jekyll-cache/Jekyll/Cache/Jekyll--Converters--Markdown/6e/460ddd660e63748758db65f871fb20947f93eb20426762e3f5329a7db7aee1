I"­<p>It was hard to know what to expect of Ukraine. Would they be nuts for boneless chicken wrapped around garlic butter? Would the place have a brilliant green glow to it when the sun went down? Would it be a land of friendly, fun loving people? I had no idea whatsoever so I was here on somewhat of an educational mission, to find out what really makes these people tick and to understand exactly what Ukraine was all about.</p>
