  What a festival! I vowed to come back again some day, and two years after the original pilgrimage I was back at Worthy Farm with 100-odd thousand of my closest friends.

<p>It all started in London where I caught up with Bee and Allie and soon to be followed by Drew for a couple days of some r&amp;r before our five day weekend with very little of anything even resembling rest. While my compadres hit up the usual tourist spots along the Thames I spent my time getting all science-y in the Museum of Science, and promptly returned to the hostel to play with chemicals.</p>

<p>Wednesday morning we¬†crammed onto the party bus for the four hour journey out to Glastonbury‚Ä¶ then a 2 hour line-up through mud with 30kg backpacks and a cripple to boot.</p>

  Trudging through seemingly endless fields and dodging the plethora of tents we somehow caught up with old mate Mikey, my pal from Bristol who I somehow see more of these days than I did when he was living in Australia. He&#8217;s a good dude who&#8217;s always doing his best to make everyone happy and create the best atmosphere for everyone.

  If one thing is a certainty in England it&#8217;s rain, and the one thing we could reasonably wish for was a dry camp setup and pack up. Thankfully the weather held out to this request, then made good on it&#8217;s own promise to hammer down on the first night just so it could ensure some deliciously sloppy walkways for the rest of the week.

<p style="text-align:left;">
  It rained a little on the Friday evening too, but for the most part it was a relatively dry festival.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  U2 put on a pretty sweet performance which I wasn&#8217;t expecting, they even had a (supposedly) live cross to an astronaut on the international space station aired on the big screen to introduce Beautiful Day.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Coldplay seemed to be the talk of the festival but with a show that hasn&#8217;t really changed in two years it was a little tired. The setup also made it impossible to do things like playing on a tiny stage in the middle of the crowd like they had been doing on the Viva La Vida tour previously.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  It seemed like quite a lot of people were pretty keen to catch Beyonce and I won&#8217;t lie I was one of them. Always keen to check out acts at festivals that I probably wouldn&#8217;t pay good money to see at their own concert and I figured she&#8217;d have a pretty elaborate stage show worth seeing, even if only for a couple songs. She kicked off the set with Crazy In Love and All The Single Ladies, so I guess I was &#8220;lucky&#8221; (?) to see her sing her two biggest hits but I was pretty unenthused about it all, her show was elaborate as ¬†expected but didn&#8217;t seem to translate too well to a massive festival stage. The punters seemed to enjoy it, but I figured I&#8217;d have a better time with Queens of The Stoneage (good choice).
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Other highlights were Morrissey, who played a great set and I am super stoked to be able to now cross off my list, Jimmy Eat World, Gaslight Anthem, OK Go and The Wombats.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Of notable mention was Pulp who played a not-so-secret set on the Park Stage which had become so packed with punters they ended up closing it off so no more people could enter. Bee and I made it in, but to say we &#8220;saw&#8221; the band might be stretching it a little. I may have caught a glimpse or two through the ridiculously thick crowd.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  City and Colour was a bit of a snoozefest and a disappointment after the great set I caught by him/them in Edmonton last year. I&#8217;m not really getting why Dallas keeps getting more and more popular while his music is getting more and more dull. Where are the hooks? Anyhoo&#8230;
</p>
