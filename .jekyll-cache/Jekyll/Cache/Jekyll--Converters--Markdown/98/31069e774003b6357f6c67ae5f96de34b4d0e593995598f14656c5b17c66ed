I"¹<p>Thatâ€™s whatâ€™ll happen to you after a weekend in Melbourne.</p>

<p>Mel had been hassling me for a few weeks now to come down and given the various things I have planned for later this year I didnâ€™t think I could afford to go down. But at the last minute (ie. 2 and a half hours in advance) I booked a flight down for Thursday night.</p>

<p>The weekend ended up going something like this: Hang out, drink, eat, sleep, eat, drink, hang out, eat, see Lungs + Paper Arms, sleep, eat, hang out, drink, watch Cop Out (on giant bean bags!!), eat, drink, see Anchors + Ride The Tiger, sleep, eat, drink, catch up with Mel Morris and her pals for a BBQ, hang out, drink, watch Gun Runners and Old Music for Old People, drink, fall asleep somewhere in the middle of Carlton, go to Luâ€™s and pass out, have Lu wake me up because my alarm went off and only managed to wake her up, run to tram stop, make way to airport, fly home.</p>

<p>Good times.</p>
