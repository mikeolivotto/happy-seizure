I"h<p>Went up to Newcastle last night for the first show of the Samiam / A Death In The Family tour. The drive up there went so quickly, had some good company in Mel and Lyndall which helped. Grabbed some pizza (I devoured a pizza to myself, then ended up eating a few slices of the pizza the girls shared, plus some garlic bread). Beer munchies most likely.</p>
