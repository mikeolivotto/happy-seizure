I"T<p>Siberia has not exactly lived up to expectations so far. Considering we came from a snowy Mongolia, it seemed odd to arrive to Irkutsk and be walking around comfortably in shorts and t shirts, but now 5 days later it started snowing on us againâ€¦ Still not cold enough to accumulate though, it all just melts as it hits the ground.</p>
