I"„<p>I really canâ€™t be bothered typing everything out hey. So summary:</p>

<p>-work all day Friday<br />
-go to airport. Flight leaves without hitch<br />
-get to Dubai. Airport is nothing out of the ordinary.<br />
-plane leaves gate on timeâ€¦ only to turn back to the gate with some problem. Sit in the plane for 2 hours waiting for it to be fixed. Plane is airworthy, so we fly on to London YAYYYY<br />
-slight runny nose turns into a non-stop leak. 7 hours of this, awesome fun!<br />
-get to London, make way to hostel as fast as possible (the exxy London Heathrow Express train) only to find they canâ€™t check me in just yet because theyâ€™re changing over shiftsâ€¦<br />
-currently waiting to check in so I can get changed and head to the festivalâ€¦ already missed one band I want to see. At least thereâ€™s tomorrow.</p>

<p>Seeing olâ€™ mate Tim and maybe Linda tonight. SWEEEEEET</p>
