I"C<p>The more you know: Skype is an Estonian company (although the head office is situated in Luxembourgâ€¦ incidentally, Luxembourg is the capital of Luxembourg. Howâ€™s that for an educational blog?!).</p>

<p>We hopped on a cruise from Helsinki to the Estonian capital, Tallin, for a two hour ride across the Baltic. The awesome weather is back and itâ€™s been quite warm. This stop was kind of designed as a two-day chill out before heading down to Riga in Latvia and then onto Kiev.</p>

<p>We were all pretty instantly pleased with the choice to come here. There arenâ€™t really any must-see sights specifically, but the â€˜old townâ€™ section which is contained within some old timey city walls was a neat little network of cobbled alleys and laneways making for some good chilling out and people watching. Compared to Finland this place is quite reasonable with prices and Iâ€™m pretty happy to finally be back in countries that understand coffee and take it seriously. Ahhhh Iâ€™ve missed the good stuff.</p>

<p>The only real commentary I have is really pretty stupid when I think about it, but given a complete lack of knowledge of Eastern Europe I was expecting a place that was much smaller, much more quiet and I guess without quite the same abundance of â€˜everyday luxuriesâ€™ youâ€™d expect in any western country. If I didnâ€™t know better, someone could have convinced me we were anywhere in western Europe.</p>

<p>Dave and I went for a bit of an aimless wander yesterday and came across some pretty large and relatively abstract concrete structures which turned out to be a war memorial. Strangely enough there were absolutely no plaques or anything to explain what was going on.</p>

<p>I definitely recommend Tallinn if you ever get a chance to head up this way at all.</p>
