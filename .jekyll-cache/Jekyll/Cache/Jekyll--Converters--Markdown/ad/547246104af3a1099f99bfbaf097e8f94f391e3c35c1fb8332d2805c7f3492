I"Ø<p>Ahhh, good old SeeTickets. Theyâ€™re the people who handle Glastonbury Festival tickets. This morning I was looking at the status of my order on their tracking page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tickets are in stock and will be despatched shortly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Iâ€™m three and a half weeks from leaving! Pretty sure the tix donâ€™t get express-posted, and &lt;25 days till I leave doesnâ€™t leave much time for delivery FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD!</p>

<p>Then I come home to this:</p>

<div id="attachment_48" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://happyseizure.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/glasto.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-48" title="Glasto!" src="http://happyseizure.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/glasto.jpg?w=300" alt="My Glastonbury ticket! Complete with photo on it!" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://happyseizure.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/glasto.jpg 1632w, https://happyseizure.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/glasto-300x225.jpg 300w, https://happyseizure.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/glasto-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    My Glastonbury ticket! Complete with photo on it!
  </p>
</div>

<p>Now all Iâ€™m waiting on is my Eurail Pass, but that shouldnâ€™t be too longâ€¦ oh, and Drew is waiting on our Spinal Tap tix to arrive, but Iâ€™m less worried about those than a $400 ticket, especially since theyâ€™re doing Glastonbury anyway.</p>
