I"ë<p>From Beijing we took an early morning train up to Erenhotâ€¦ or Erlian, weâ€™re not quite sure (the town seems to have 2 names, but itâ€™s hard to work out). We passed time by sleeping and eating food, but mostly by playing games of Big 2 or Uno (High School Musical 2 edition!). The scenery was pretty samey, after the first couple hours out of Beijing and its mountainous terrain we wound up heading through the Gobi Desert, and subsequently filled our carriage with sand and dust.</p>
