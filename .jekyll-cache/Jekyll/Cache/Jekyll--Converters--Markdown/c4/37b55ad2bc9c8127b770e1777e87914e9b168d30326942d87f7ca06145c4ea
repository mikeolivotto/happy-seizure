I"â<p>The next few months are ramping up to be huge in terms of new releases, Iâ€™m really looking forward to a few of them particularly the new Alexisonfire record and Moneenâ€™s teaser EPâ€¦</p>

<p>A whole bunch of new songs have gone up over the past few days, give them a listen!</p>

<p><strong>Look Mexico</strong>, theyâ€™ve just signed to Suburban Home and are demoing at the moment, a couple are up on their myspace:<br />

</a> These wonâ€™t be up for long I donâ€™t think so listen to them now! These guys will be big!</p>

<p><strong>Moneen</strong>. New 4 track EP through Dine Alone Records, only available on 12â€³â€¦ Might pick one of these up when I catch them in London in a couple weeks. Album is streaming over at Vinyl Collective:<br />

<p><strong>Alexisonfire</strong>. I think Iâ€™m going to really enjoy this oneâ€¦ judging by the 2 tracks that have surfaced it sounds like theyâ€™re shifting away from relying so heavily on Dallasâ€™ vocals and going for a more gruff and raw sound while still doing it different to how they have in the past. I want. Now.<br />

<p><strong>Set Your Goals</strong>. New album out in a month or two, the first new song (<em>Fallen</em>) is catchy as hell and incredible live! Another newy, <em>This Will Be The Death Of Us</em>, just went up today or yesterday and Iâ€™m not quite sold yet but thatâ€™s exactly how I felt about Mutiny the first time I listened to itâ€¦ I have faith in these guys, I know Iâ€™ll be picking up that record ASAP.<br />

<p>And on a completely unrelated note hereâ€™s some footage from Sasquatch festival in Washington that a friend who went showed meâ€¦ This is hilarious! Itâ€™ll take about a minute to really kick in but itâ€™s totally worth watching the whole clip!</p>
