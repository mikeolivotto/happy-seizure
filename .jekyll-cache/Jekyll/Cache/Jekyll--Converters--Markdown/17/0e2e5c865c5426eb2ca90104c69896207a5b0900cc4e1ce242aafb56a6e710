I"~<p>So getting from Prague to Venice proved to be either way too time consuming or expensive. Or even both. Looks like I have to change my plans and head down to Italy via Bern (Switzerland) which will be cool, jusrt completely different to how I imagined I would tackle Europe.</p>

<p>Anyway I split from Drew and Ash this morning and I’m in Munich now which I’m actually really stoked about, I didn’t expect I would actually have the chance to make it here so one hinderance actually turned into something really positive. Don’t know yet whether I will leave tomorrow or stay another night, I might go for a walk this arvo and decide later tonight.</p>

<p>I was homeless when I arrived, and both being late afternoon and middle of summer meant getting a hostel wasn’t easy. In fact, not even possible so I’ve booked some hotel for the night, looks like there are a few hostels available for tomorrow night if I can decide early enough that I want to stay. Worry about that later anyway.</p>

<p>Right now it’s really hot and I’ve already wasted an hour or so of sightseeing by being here looking for accom so I’m off again.</p>
