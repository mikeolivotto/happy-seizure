  So after who-knows-how-long my copy of <em>Common Existence</em> finally arrived at Beatdisc.

Nice double LP even though there&#8217;s actually only 3 sides&#8230; the 4th is laser-etched with the dove logo and some lyrics, it actually looks pretty cool. And while on the subject Victory the other day announced a re-press of _Full Collapse_ on brown. Needless to say I smacked the credit card down on that one as soon as I heard about it, the bummer is that it probably won&#8217;t actually arrive here before I go away. At least it will be like coming home to a present, by which time I&#8217;ll probably have forgotten ordering it anyway.
