I would update this thing proper if the hotel internet didn&#8217;t suck.

I&#8217;m at the Fest with Mel, it&#8217;s awesome. Florida has been good, we&#8217;ve done Wet N Wild, Universal Studios and eaten at Taco Bus. Yes, a bus that sells Mexican food. It was incredible.

So that&#8217;s all the update you get for now. Pictures and stories coming soon.
